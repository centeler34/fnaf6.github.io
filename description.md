Build a modern, visually appealing website that uses the assets folder.  

Requirements:  
1. On load, play an audio file from assets/audio/.  
2. Subtitles:
   - Use an array of text lines in JavaScript.  
   - Each subtitle should fade in, stay for a few seconds, then fade out as the next one appears.  
   - Position subtitles in the center of the screen with a dramatic, modern look.  
3. Backgrounds:
   - Load and shuffle images from assets/backgrounds/.  
   - Crossfade smoothly between background images every few seconds.  
4. Styling:
   - Place all styles in assets/css/style.css.  
   - Come up with a creative UI design yourself.  
   - Since this is a FNAF 6 ending reference, make the design dark, eerie, and atmospheric.  
   - You may choose fonts, colors, overlays, glow effects, or any animation style you think enhances the creepy/epic vibe.  
5. JavaScript:
   - Place all logic in assets/js/script.js.  
   - Handle audio playback, subtitle timing, and background image shuffling.  
6. Extra:
   - You are allowed to add anything else you think will make the experience cooler (extra effects, flickers, transitions, etc.).  
   - The goal is to feel like a FNAF 6 ending tribute.  
7. Responsiveness:
   - Make sure the design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
8. Output index.html, style.css, and script.js with placeholder subtitles, audio, and backgrounds.
